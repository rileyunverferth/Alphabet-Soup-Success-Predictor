## Module 21 Challenge

In this challenge we are using machine learning and neural networks help a fictional nonprofit foundation,  Alphabet Soup, to select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Using the features in the dataset, we will create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to look at how we processed our data for training, how we compiled our models, and how accurately our models performed.
